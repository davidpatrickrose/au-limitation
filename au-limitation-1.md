## Limitation of Liability

To the fullest extent permitted by the law, Limiting Party's liability to the Recipient in respect of the Subject will be limited to the Amount.  Otherwise, to the fullest extent permitted by law, Limiting Party excludes all liability (including Consequential Loss) to Recipient for any liabilities connected directly or indirectly with the Recipient and Limiting Party dealings in relation to the Subject, including liabilities based on:

- contract law;
- tort law; or
- legislation,

and including liabilities caused by the Risks.

Where there is an Exception, this limitation of liability does not apply to the subject of the Exception.

## Implied Conditions

To the fullest extent permitted by the law, all terms and conditions implied by any other source of law in relation to dealings between the Limiting Party and the Recipient in respect of the Subject are excluded from the Agreement.

## Compulsory Conditions

Where the Amount is less than the amount dictated by law for the breach of a Compulsory Condition, Limiting Party's liability to the Recipient for breaching a Compulsory Condition in relation to the Subject is limited to:

- in a case where a breach is deemed to be a breach in respect of goods:
	+ the replacement of the relevant goods or the supply of equivalent goods;
	+ the repair of the relevant goods;
	+ the payment of the cost of replacing the relevant goods or of acquiring equivalent goods; or
	+ the payment of the cost of having the relevant goods repaired,

- in a case where a breach is deemed to be a breach in respect of services:
	+ the resupply of the relevant services; or

The Limiting Party will choose which of these options will apply.
